## About me
I am a web developer with experience in creating web interfaces using two of the
most used technologies such as React and Angular. I have also had experiences
experimenting as a backend developer, although this role is to a lesser extent,
always using Node + Express + (Postgres/MondoDB) or Nestjs as framework.
